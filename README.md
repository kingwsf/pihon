# docker-openvpn-pihole
Create a single docker-compose and use the benefit from pi-hole if you use a Mobile Device outside your Home network.

Rationale for this repository: I want to connect OpenVPN to Pi-Hole as easily as possible. However, the user can make changes (meaningful to me), or just use my preferences.

Many thanks to:  
GitHub @ [kylemanna/docker-openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn/)

Now you can use this repository with the Hardwaretype x86_x64 and amr (Test with Raspberry Pi 2)
